Website for PESIT-BSC IEEE student branch

This is Karan Agarwal from PESIT BANGALORE SOUTH CAMPUS, i have developed this website for the  PESIT South Campus IEEE Student Branch.

Here are few necessary prerequisites for the website:
1.	This website requires database, so i attached the SQL file (u703255292_ieee.sql) along with the code.
		Its on the localhost and with following configurations:
						DB_SERVER	-	""
						DB_USER		-	""
						DB_PASS		-	""
						DB_NAME		-	"pesit_ieee"

	Incase you want to change the above configurations, please go to CODE\includes\db_connection.php

2.	Some of the css part requires internet connection.
